Worked in a team of 4 to develop a web app from scratch.

This app recommends schools to users based on their interests and requirements.

Prior to this project, my team had zero experience in web development.

This project involves both design and implementation.

Design: functional and non-functional requirements, use case model, initial user interface design, dialog map, system architecture, class diagrams, sequence diagrams

Implementation: source code and white box and black box testing
