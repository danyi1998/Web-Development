Worked in a small team of 4 to build a web app from scratch. All of our members had zero experience in web development prior to this project. 

This project involves both design and implementation. 

Design: Functional and non-functional requirements, use case model, initial user interface design, dialog map, system architecture, class diagrams and sequence diagrams.

Implementation: source code and testing.
